# Hyperclusters

This public repository contains all code for the project entitled: "Catastrophic “hyperclustering” and recurrent losses: diagnosing U.S. flood insurance insolvency triggers" published in npj Natural Hazards. Specifically, the repository contains all code and associated data for our hyperclustering and recurrent loss analysis. 

We refer to the USA_return_periods repository for code regarding precipitation return period calculations. This repository is currently under maintenance and code is being refined to enhance user accessibility. The code base and data will be updated shortly to reflect all cleaned and up-to-date files.  The code base and data will be available shortly. For inquiries about access or code use, please reach out directly to an3232@columbia.edu to get the most up-to-date files. Thank you!

## Abstract
Although a cornerstone of U.S. flood risk preparedness since 1968, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), is burdened by insolvency. Despite pricing and risk assessment reforms, systemic failures persist, resulting in the accumulation of billions in federal debt. This study presents an interdisciplinary framework integrating qualitative synthesis, unsupervised machine learning, and game theory to diagnose triggers of insolvency. We identify catastrophic “hyperclustering” as large-scale flood events spanning days to weeks and induced by a common hydrometeorological driver, which dominate claim volumes often in regions of high asset density. We find chronic annual losses arise from recurrent claims, emphasizing the need for proactive managed retreat from high-risk areas. Our findings support targeted NFIP reform and broader risk management, particularly as climate extremes intensify the homeowners’ insurance crisis. We argue that long-term resilience requires aligning financial, structural, and non-structural interventions with distinct regional risk patterns—whether driven by hyperclustering, recurrent losses, or both.
